## Race, Culture, and Religion

Long ago, the various different mystical races were separated on different islands. Because of this, many cultures in Valwen can be traced back to individual mystical races. Now, intermingling between different islands has caused these racial distinctions to become less significant. Thus, ones culture and race need not be linked. One link that remains incredibly strong is the link between religion and culture. Thus, while it is not impossible to be of one culture and believe in the deity of another, this is very rare and may lead to ostracism from the community.

### The Heimlish

The largest and most dominant culture in Valwen, the Heimlish trace their cultural heritage back to the frigid waste of Loftheim. Today, roughly fifty percent of the known world identifies as Heimlish. Their language is so pervasive, that it takes the place of the normal Pathfinder language common. Words such as Aether and Valwen come from the Heimlish language. The Heimlish worship [[Religions of Valwen#The Aethir|the Aethir]], great giants who dwell on the Isle of Ilwen. They believe that Valwen is a giant, intricate chandelier crafted by the tinkering god [[Religions of Valwen#Vanuk, the Tinkerer God|Vanuk]] in honor of his brother, [[Religions of Valwen#Valorum, the Law Giver|Valorum]], and his marriage to the goddess [[Religions of Valwen#Ilil, the All-Mother|Ilil]]. Ilil later filled Valwen with plants and animals, some of which found favor in the eyes of Valorum. To these creatures, Valorum gave morality, so that they would strive towards greater things.

Heimlish society places great significance on craftsmanship
