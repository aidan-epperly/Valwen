*While some Walkers claim to be able to find Touchstones through some unknown sixth-sense, it needs must be remarked that these same such Walkers are the exactly those who would never be caught dead without a compass.*

## Navigation without Magnetism
---
There is no measurable magnetic field in Valwen, barring certain sufficiently large iron-rich mountains. As a result, magnetic compasses do not exist. There are, however, compasses that use a different method to function. If a material, particularly metal, passes through a specific Touchstone enough times, it will begin to be attracted to that Touchstone. As a result, compasses can be made by creating needles that are specifically attracted to well known Touchstones.
