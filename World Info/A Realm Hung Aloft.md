*In the first days the 
World was whole
Streams made not to
Weep mountains 
Restrained great
Celestial bars 
Hanging all aloft*

Valwen is not a planet. It is instead a collection of islands great and small, floating in an infinite expanse known as the Aether. Islands come in all shapes and sizes, ranging from roughly the size of a continent to the size of a small house. Most islands are illuminated by a large, luminiferous sun-like object that lights every morning in a brilliant display, and smolders much like a candle at the end of its wick into darkness each night. 

Most people never leave the island they were born on. Those who do are called Aether Walkers, Walkers for short. Walkers traverse the Aether through a series of large stone gates referred to as Touchstones. Every Touchstone is naturally attuned to another, making transport between paired Stones quiet easy. This is how a majority of Touchstone travel is done. Some Walker groups, however, seem to be able to freely travel between any Touchstones they chose. Members of such groups are highly respected, and often feared, by fellow Walkers and Islanders alike and they can often be found in the employ of great rulers and on the winning sides of inter-island wars.

As you can imagine, Stones are incredibly central in determining who has and doesn't have political, economic, military, and even religious power. You can tell a lot about how power is distributed by seeing which group controls the Stones. Depending on the circumstances, it is not uncommon to see Stones controlled by large churches, powerful guilds, local lords, or even entirely controlled by a single government, monarchy or otherwise. Walker guilds often control Stones that others deem unimportant or useless. Sometimes, if enough Touchstones fall into the hands of friendly groups of Walkers, this can create a long meandering path between two major islands. These paths are often the preferred method of travel for Walkers as they allow safe travel between important places without having to pay large fees or submit to annoying inspections.
