Q: Are the touchstones large features of the land or something smaller that can be moved? I ask this as if they are more features then this could really effect where settlements build up and how easy it is to control them etc.

A: There are very large ones capable of transporting many people at a time and small ones able to transfer roughly a person at a time.

Q: Are the walkers defined by having traveled or being able to travel? i.e. is this an innate ability few possess or an opportunity few possess? N.B. I'm asking about those going between paired stones, I'm happy to keep the special group a mystery, it's just that if it's an innate ability that really would affect community again, for example some islands might have testing days with walkers that are revealed being adopted into important families because their alliance is worth a lot.

A: You're a Walker if a Walker thinks you're a Walker. No one really conceptualizes farmers hauling their crops to market on the other side of one Touchstone to be Walkers. In general though, Walker just refers to people who frequently travel between different islands.

Q: Are the islands all at the same level on the vertical plane? How far apart are they? I'm thinking about whether birds can fly between some of them and whether winds might cause cross-pollination or not and whether any islands can see the bottom of another island.

A: No. You've got islands in all directions. The stars in the sky at night are other islands that are having their day time. There are no known islands close enough to each other to see anything but a light.

Q: Do the lights all start and stop at the same time? Are they high up enough above the island that they light it equally, or are the edges of islands getting less light and warmth (could effect settlement placement, agriculture, amount of biological drift between islands)? Are there any star or moon equivalents (how dark and foreboding is the night, how much are light sources prized)?

A: Lights are seemingly not coordinated on when they turn on and off. They also appear relatively close and move relative to the observer so they light roughly evenly across the whole island. Night is pretty dark. There is no moon, only a *very* faintly glowing red sphere in the sky.

Q: You mentioned religion, is this a world where the Gods are proven to be real like many DnD settings, or a world where people believe but there isn't the hard proof and people disagree?

A: Well, here's a quote from [[Religions of Valwen]], *Valwen, like Earth, is home to many religions worshipping a number of different deities. Unlike the Pathfinder pantheon, many of the following deities cannot possibly coexist, and yet, clerics and paladins following each of these deities seemingly gain spells through worshiping them.*
