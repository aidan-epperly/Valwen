*Good friends, good beer, good stories.*

-Bruk Family Motto

## A Family of Nomads
---
Patron family of [[Forgrad]], the city in the West, the Bruks are a family of Half-Orcs, most of whom do not live in [[Myrheim]]. The family values adventuring and self-determination. They maintain the local Walker guild and finance the great mead hall [[Halvask]].

### Culture, Religion, and Values
---
The Bruks are [[Cultures of Valwen#The Solahm|Solahm]], making them culturally disjoint from much of Myrheim.
