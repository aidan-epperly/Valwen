## A Diverse Group
---
The Fey are mysterious and diverse. There are unique Fey on every island inhabited by sentient races. Unlike many of the other magical races, Fey usually cannot be found away from their home isle. Some are physically or spiritually tied to the land on which they were born, and others fear persecution from other cultures. That being said, there are some Fey that seem to follow various [[Cultures of Valwen|cultures]] wherever they go.

### The Dwem
---
Wherever you find the [[Cultures of Valwen#The Heimlish|Heimlish]], you will also find the Dwem, a race of powerful and devious servants of [[Religions of Valwen#Strog, the Two-Faced Fool|Strog]]. The Dwem are the ancestors of the Gnomes, and share many of the same characteristics. However, they are much more powerful. Untrained Dwem can range in power from roughly the power of an apprentice mage to that of a great dragon.

#### The Low Dwem
---
Often indistinguishable from the gnomes, the Low Dwem can often be found living in society among them. The Low Dwem often hide their lineage for fear of persecution, but some, especially in recent years, are outspoken about their race.

#### The All Dwem
---
The most diverse group of Dwem, the title of All Dwem is bestowed upon any Dwem with magic surpassing that of an average wizard. All Dwem range in size and shape from small fairy-like Dwem with wings to massive ogre-like beings.

#### The High Dwem
---
Some of the most powerful beings throughout the Aether. A single High Dwem can topple a nation or level a city. The greatest of all the High Dwem are the six Councilmen, who are sometimes worshiped by other Dwem as gods second only to Strog.

#### Culture of the Dwem
---
The Dwem are known for their odd and often incomprehensible rules. As servants of Strog, this should be expected.
