*Dur take us! If I have to deal with one more report of a robbery this week, I'm gonna pack my bags and leave this god forsaken town.*

-Former Forgrad Captain of the Guard

## The Forsaken City of Forgrad
---
A backwater by any measure, Forgrad is a city of crime and general lawlessness. Potentially the only reason that the city still exists is the existence of the [[Myrheim Aether Walker Guild]]. The Guild is the closest thing that the city has to a real government, though [[The Bruks|the Bruk family]] does nominally control the city as well. The family also runs the great mead hall Halvask, the most impressive building in the city. Some say that Forgrad used to be a better place, but it is unclear if this is merely unfounded nostalgia, or actually true.

### Crime and Politics
---
Forgrad is, in theory, governed by the Bruk family. The family does not seem particularly interested in this task, however, so the city is lousy with mismanaged projects and good-for-nothings in positions of power. The Walker Guild maintains a degree of order around Halvask, so the areas around are often considered to be the best place to live in town. Even this protection is tenuous as bar fights and parties in Halvask have a tendency to get out of hand and spill into the surrounding neighborhood.

#### Powerful Groups
---
##### The Aether Walker Guild
---
The most powerful institution in the city, the Walker Guild has roughly a hundred local members and strong relations with many neighboring guilds. At any given time, there can be as many as three hundred walkers staying in Forgrad. While this is not a terribly large amount of people, the average Walker is considerably stronger than the average citizen or back alley rogue.
