*Oh, I'll go to Easton town m'lass, I'll go to Easton town. 
And make myself a merchant man, the finest kind around*

-Myrheim Folk Song

## The Great Trade City of Easton
---
The largest and most prosperous city in [[Myrheim]], Easton is located, shockingly, in the East of Myrheim. However, in a stunning twist, the term East actually comes from the city and not the [[Compasses|other way around]]. Easton's primary export is grain and alcohol, specializing in beer. Recently, a new method for creating alcohol known as distillation has been discovered which may end up "changing the game" so-to-speak. Aside from it's exports, Easton makes most of it's money charging a form of sales tax and providing food, lodging, and hospitality to merchants and travelers.

### Crime and Politics
---
Easton is a guild city, run by and for the guilds within its borders. Each guild elects two representatives who serve on the town council. The first member elect is given one vote for every hundred members they have in the guild, while the second is given one vote for every hundred gold their guild made in profit that month. This system was originally set up by the town's founding family [[Myrheim#The Fieldings|the Fieldings]], who have maintained a massive amount of power within Easton and are *technically* considered a guild unto themselves.

#### Powerful Groups

##### The Fielding Family
---
Patron family of [[Easton]], the Fieldings are a family of Humans living on the top of the Fielding's Inn, the most well known and well respected dinning and lodgings establishment on the island. The family is quite well known around town and members can be seen walking around the nicer parts of town quite often: always accompanied by highly trained guards.

##### The Ymil Family
---
A powerful family in Easton, the Ymil family is known for their high end healing items, both magical and non-magical. The family founded and helps to run the Guild of Healers and Medics, which owns and operates Ilwel, a state-of-the-art medical facility boasting some of the best healthcare outside of the churches. Ilwel even offers healthcare free of charge to those who cannot afford to pay, which has given the family a lot of good will in the community.

Recently, the head of the Ymil family passed away while his son was away on business, leaving the family without a strong leader. Nevertheless, the family is steadfast in its determination to help the community and improve the lives of all.
