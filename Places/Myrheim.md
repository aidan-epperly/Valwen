*The isle of Myrheim is roughly the size of modern day France. There are four known large Touchstones on the island, one for each of the cardinal directions. The island is ruled by a single elected monarch. The position of Ruler is granted for life, and the Ruler is elected by a vote of the four major families. Upon taking the signifiers of office, the Ruler is magically bound to having no children.*

## Major Families of Myrheim
---
### The Haversomes

Patron family of Welgard, the city in the North, the Haversomes are a family of Dwarves living in the great Haversome Keep. The family is relatively reclusive, only emerging for the yearly festival that they host and the vote upon the death of the most recent Ruler.

### The Fieldings

Patron family of [[Easton]], the city in the East, the Fieldings are a family of Humans living on the top of the Fielding's Inn, the most well known and well respected dinning and lodgings establishment on the island. The family is quite well known around town and members can be seen walking around the nicer parts of town quite often: always accompanied by highly trained guards.

### The Bruks

Patron family of [[Forgrad]], the city in the West, the Bruks are a family of Half-Orcs, most of whom do not live in Myrheim. The family values adventuring and self-determination. They maintain the local Walker guild and finance the great mead hall [[Halvask]].

### The Wendles

Patron family of Feltland, the city in the South, the Wendles are a diverse family of elves, half-elves, and humans, most of whom live in Wendle manor. The family is somewhat reclusive, though every week they hold council where those who live in their town can bring up problems.
