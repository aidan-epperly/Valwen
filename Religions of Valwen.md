*Valwen, like Earth, is home to many religions worshipping a number of different deities. Unlike the Pathfinder pantheon, many of the following deities cannot possibly coexist, and yet, clerics and paladins following each of these deities seemingly gain spells through worshiping them.*

#### Souls Entwined and Torn Asunder

Long ago, the world was whole, an unbroken infinite plane extending beyond mortal comprehension. Yarra, the One Who Came Before, resided there. Alone. For a time, Yarra found the world exciting, sculpting in it great peaks and valleys. Yarra grew to love the world, but the world could not return his affections. His sadness grew so great that his tears filled the deepest valleys of hist creation. The One Who Came Before grew tired of his loneliness and set out hoping to find someone else: someone to love and love him back. 

Yarra walked for eternity until he reached the Edge. Upon his arrival at the End of Places, the One Who Came Before collapsed in anguish, knowing then that he would be alone forever. Suddenly, as if somehow Yarra's desperate heart had dragged her from beyond the Edge, Naru, the First Walker, stepped foot into reality. Upon seeing her, Yarra's heart was alight with joy at the prospect of finally finding another to love and be loved by in return.

Naru, the First Walker, stared inquisitively down at the One Who Came Before crumpled beneath her and felt pity for him. Leaning down, the First Walker lifted Yarra to his feet telling him, *Rise and be happy, for there was no reason to be sad!* Yarra could only manage a gasp, unable to understand the eloquent sound emanating from Naru's lips. They were to him like a cool sea breeze on a warm day, but he knew not what she said.

From that day forward, Yarra and Naru were inseparable. Naru loved teaching Yarra all that she knew. She taught him language, music, and poetry. She helped Yarra hang the clouds in the sky and fill the lands with plants and animals so that he would never have to be alone again. Yarra was entranced by Naru, believing her to be his from reality itself: repayment for many eternities of pain and suffering. They lived like this, together, for many eternities building and rebuilding the world.

This bliss could not last forever.

On the Day of Fracture, Yarra awoke to find Naru missing. He quickly scoured all of his creations looking for her, worried that the universe may have taken back his prize. After many hours of searching, the One Who Came Before found his beloved, dressed in all of her traveling clothes, stooping low to the ground fashioning a final present to Yarra. Enraged and heart broken at what he knew to be Naru's imminent departure, Yarra charged at Naru desperate to keep her with him forever. In order to escape Yarra's pursuit, Naru tore down reality itself in her retreat, fracturing the world upon which they both stood. Naru, familiar with the void she had called home, was easily able to move between the shards of reality. Yarra, in an effort to pursue Naru, created the Touchstones from the Earth so that he could follow wherever Naru went.

#### A Present Fit for a King

In the beginning, there was Aether, and from it emerged Ilwen, a land unlike any known to mortal kind. A man could start at one end and walk for his entire life without reaching the end. Then came the Aethir, giants born of Aether, to dwell upon the Isle of Ilwen. Valorum, the greatest of the giants, was made king over all for there was none other so well equipped for the task. Under his leadership the Aethir erected great towers and bridged the mountains.

In time, the great King fell in love with the goddess Ilil, and the two planned to be married. Wishing to give his brother a magnificent wedding gift, Vanuk began crafting a beautiful chandelier of islands much like their home of Ilwen. Wishing to use only the finest of materials, Vanuk sought the help of the mad god Strog, who was lord of light and darkness. After listening to Vanuk's request, the Two-Faced Fool told Vanuk that the only light bright enough would be the Great Light above. Happy with this response, Vanuk climbed into the skies with his largest sack to pluck handfuls of light from the Great Light above. He took and he took until his bag was full, and then he secreted away to his workshop to continue his grand gift.
