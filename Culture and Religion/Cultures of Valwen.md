## Race, Culture, and Religion
---
Long ago, the various different mystical races were separated on different islands. Because of this, many cultures in Valwen can be traced back to individual mystical races. Now, intermingling between different islands has caused these racial distinctions to become less significant. Thus, ones culture and race need not be linked. One link that remains incredibly strong is the link between religion and culture. Thus, while it is not impossible to be of one culture and believe in the deity of another, this is very rare and may lead to ostracism from the community.

### The Heimlish

The largest and most dominant culture in Valwen, the Heimlish trace their cultural heritage back to the frigid waste of Loftheim. Today, roughly fifty percent of the known world identifies as Heimlish. Their language is so pervasive, that it takes the place of the normal Pathfinder language common. Words such as Aether and Valwen come from the Heimlish language. The Heimlish worship [[Religions of Valwen#The Aethir|the Aethir]], great giants who dwell on the Isle of Ilwen. They believe that Valwen is a giant, intricate chandelier crafted by the tinkering god [[Religions of Valwen#Vanuk, the Tinkerer God|Vanuk]] in honor of his brother, [[Religions of Valwen#Valorum, the Law Giver|Valorum]], and his marriage to the goddess [[Religions of Valwen#Ilil, the All-Mother|Ilil]]. Ilil later filled Valwen with plants and animals, some of which found favor in the eyes of Valorum. To these creatures, Valorum gave morality, so that they would strive towards greater things. 

Heimlish society places great significance on craftsmanship in all its forms, as well as in lawfulness. Most Heimlish trace their heritage back to Dwarves in some way, though most Heimlish at this point are more human than Dwarven. It is also not uncommon for Gnomes, Orcs, and Half-Orcs to identify as Heimlish. While not particularly tolerant of other cultures, they highly value skilled craftsmen from all walks of life.

### The Naki

The second most common culture in Valwen, the Naki trace their heritage to the forest island of Tarki. Today, roughly thirty percent of the known world identifies as Naki. Their language is the equivalent of Elven, and is commonly known among the educated of most cultures. Most Naki worship [[Religions of Valwen#Naru, the First Walker|Naru]], goddess of freedom, chaos, and nature. They believe the world was once an infinite plane extending in every direction until Naru broke it in order to flee from [[Religions of Valwen#Yarra, the One Who Came Before|Yarra]], god of law, earth, and death.

Naki society places great significance on balance, believing that too much disorder can lead to devastation and too much order to disfunction. Most Naki trace their heritage back to the Elves, though the largest racial group of Naki are now Half-Elves. It is not uncommon for Halflings, Gnomes, and Humans to be Naki. The Naki are highly tolerant of other people and cultures.

### The Solahm

The third most common culture in Valwen, the Solahm trace their heritage to the desert island of Soltai. Today, roughly fifteen percent of the population of the known world identifies as Solahm. Their language is the equivalent of Orcish and is not commonly known outside of their culture. The Solahm believe that while the god Algahm was forging the sun on his anvil the sparks that flew off solidified and became the isles upon which you stand today. They also believe the the lights above are the coals of Algahm's great forge, given to humanity so that they might see.

Solahm society places great significance on endurance and stoicism. Most Heimlish trace their heritage back to Orcs in come way, It is not uncommon for Humans, Gnomes, Halflings, and Goblins to identify as Solahm. They are a tolerant group culturally but not otherwise.
